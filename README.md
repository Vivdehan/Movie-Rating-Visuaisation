Movie Rating Visualisation
In this project we’ll visualize the dataset of 500 Companies and based on our analysis, we’ll draw useful insights but before that our dataset contains numerous discrepancies which we need to fix before proceeding with our analysis. So, we’ll first write codes in R for fixing numerous discrepancies and we do this because we want our dataset to be robust. After all, it makes analysis smooth and effortless and we’ll also see how to streamline the process of data preparation so that we spend less time there and will make fewer errors and we have less room for error because we know what we are doing.
We’ll also want to investigate the potential threats that we're faced with, when we prepare data and in this project, we're going to see a lot about locating missing data and how to find it, how to replace missing out what to do about it.

We also have a few methods of placing missing data. one of the more advanced methods will be the main method i.e the median imputation method is a very powerful technique that is used in our programming for different types of analytics
The end of the Pdf contains the R code to perform the operation.
